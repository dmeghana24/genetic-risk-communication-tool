##Data Integration and Preprocessing
#In data_integration.py, implement functions to:
#Load genomic datasets (e.g., from 1000 Genomes Project)
#Create simulated EHR data
#Link genetic variants to health risks

def preprocess_data(data):
    # Clean, normalize, and format data for NLP tasks
    pass
